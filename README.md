# EfficientNetLite_ONNX

<h2>main.py</h2>
<p>This code downloads the EfficientNetLite models from TensorFlow Hub and saves them for use in TensorFlow.</p>

<h3>ONNX_Lite.py</h3>
<p>This code loads the EfficientNetLite models using TensorFlow, converts them to the ONNX format using tf2onnx, and saves the ONNX models.</p>

<h3>Lite_1.py</h3>
<p>This code downloads the EfficientNetLite models from TensorFlow Hub, builds them as TensorFlow Keras Sequential models with the specified versions, and saves them. These pre-trained models can be easily used for various computer vision tasks such as image classification or object detection.</p>
